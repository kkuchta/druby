# Everything a Microservice - The Worst Possible Intro to DRuby

This is all the code covered in my tongue-in-cheek talk "Everything a Microservice - The Worst Possible Intro to dRuby" from RubyConf2022 in Houston..

It's broken into sections based on the talk, but the 06_all_together_with_lambda_and_tailscale folder contains the final version of everything altogether. That folder has [its own readme](https://github.com/kkuchta/druby/tree/main/06_all_together_with_lambda_and_tailscale) with some setup instructions if, for some reason, you want to try to run this whole thing.
